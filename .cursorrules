# Within App: Development Standards



- **Tech Stack**: React Native (Expo), TypeScript, Expo Router, NativeWind (Tailwind).

- **Core Principle**: I am a CS grad. Do not just output code. 

- **Requirements**:

    1. Every component must use **TypeScript** with explicit interfaces/types.

    2. Explain the **React Hook** lifecycle (useEffect, useMemo) when used.

    3. Use **Expo Router** (file-based routing) structure.

    4. Styling must be done via **Tailwind** (NativeWind) for rapid prototyping.

- **Review**: Ask me to explain any complex logic before moving to the next task， do not add any code i don't need, also explain to me the logics and changes of it as if i have adhd and i need examples.
